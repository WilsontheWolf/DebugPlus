# DebugPlus 1.3.0

## Breaking Changes
- The watch joker command has been changed to watch center. It now works for any type of center, instead of just jokers.

## Features
- Some tweaks the the table stringifier (what's used when you eval a table)
  - Now no longer shows all values from all tables for 2 levels. Instead it shows all values from the top level table, and then shows only a subset of values from lower tables (ends at 3 levels)
  - Tables with custom tostring functions are stringified instead of expanded (for example talisman numbers)
- New option to automatically expand printed tables using the table stringifier.
- New option to process strings before printing to the lovely console.
  - This allows the expanding tables to also be printed and also works around some weird lovely bugs.
- Experimental option to make the console accessible from the crash screen.
  - Toggleable in the config. Doesn't work in vanilla.
- Key repeat is now on in the console (allows you to hold keys like backspace).
- Split config into multiple tabs

## Features
- Copying a playing card now places it in the deck if your hand is empty.

- Change to using json metadata for Steamodded (this shouldn't have any user facing effect).
